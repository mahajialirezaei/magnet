# Magnet

This repository is dedicated to a data analysis and visualization project focused on the concept of "magnet." The project leverages various datasets and analysis techniques to explore different aspects related to the concept of magnetism, remote growth, and job posts.

## Overview

The goal of the Magnet project is to analyze and visualize data related to magnets, remote work growth, and job posting trends. The analysis is conducted using Jupyter Notebooks, where we explore and visualize data through various interactive and static visualizations.

## Repository Contents

- **quera_magnet.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook that contains the primary analysis and visualization of the magnet and related data.
- **df.csv**: A dataset used for the analysis, which contains relevant data points.
- **job_posts.csv**: A dataset of job postings used to analyze trends in remote work opportunities.
- **result.zip**: A zipped folder containing results and additional data output from the analysis.
- **discrete_time**: A folder containing data related to time intervals used in the analysis.
